# Day05: Python Basics — Variables, Numbers and Strings 🔢🔤

## ?? Topics Covered
- Overview of the lesson
- Example Python code
- Exercises and quizzes


In this section, we explore the **building blocks of Python programming** — Variables, Numbers, and Strings.  
You’ll learn how to store values, work with numeric data, and manipulate text.  

---

## 5.1: Variables 📦
- Variables are **named containers** for storing data.  
- You don’t need to declare a type in Python (it’s dynamic).  

```python
# Examples
name = "Alice"     # String variable
age = 25           # Integer variable
height = 5.6       # Float variable
is_student = True  # Boolean variable


---

## 5.2: Numbers 🔢

* Python supports:

  * **Integers** → Whole numbers (10, -5, 0)
  * **Floats** → Decimal numbers (3.14, -2.5)
  * **Complex Numbers** → (2+3j)

```python
a = 10
b = 3.5

print(a + b)   # Addition
print(a * b)   # Multiplication
print(a // 3)  # Floor division
```

---

## 5.3: Strings 🔤

* Strings store **text data** inside quotes.
* Can use **single (' ')** or **double (" ")** quotes.

```python
message = "Hello, Python!"

# String operations
print(message.upper())      # HELLO, PYTHON!
print(message.lower())      # hello, python!
print(message[0:5])         # Hello (slicing)
print("Python" in message)  # True (substring check)
```

## 5.4: Quiz — Variables, Numbers and Strings ❓

1. Which of these is a valid variable name?

   * `1name`, `name1`, `first-name`, `_score`

2. What will `5 // 2` return?

   * `2` or `2.5`?

3. What is the output of:

   ```python
   text = "Python"
   print(text[2:5])
   ```

## 5.5: Mr. Beginner shares his Coding Fear with Mr. Expert 🧑‍💻👨‍🏫

* **Mr. Beginner:** "I’m scared of coding… variables, numbers, and strings look confusing!"
* **Mr. Expert:** "Don’t worry! Think of variables as boxes, numbers as math on paper, and strings as words in a notebook. It’s simple when practiced step by step."
* Moral → Fear reduces as you **practice with small examples daily**. ✅

---

## 5.6: Exercise — Variables, Numbers and Strings 📝

1. Create 3 variables: `food = 120.50`, `rent = 500.40`, `utilities = 200.75`.

   * Find total monthly expense.

2. Store your first name and last name in two variables.

   * Combine them into one full name using **f-string**.

3. Write a string `"DataScience"` and use slicing to print `"Data"`, `"Science"`, and `"DS"`.

## 5.7: Chapter Summary 📘

* Variables are containers for data.
* Numbers → Integers, Floats, Complex.
* Strings → Store text, support slicing & built-in methods.
* Practice makes coding concepts **easy & fear-free**.
