## **1.1: Course Introduction**

* Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** known for simplicity and readability.
* Created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991.
* It supports multiple paradigms: **procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming**.
* Widely used in:

  * **Web Development** (Django, Flask)
  * **Data Science & Machine Learning** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
  * **Automation/Scripting**
  * **Game Development** (Pygame)
  * **Finance & Business Analytics**
* This course will take you from **basics (syntax, variables, loops)** to **advanced (OOP, data handling, projects)**.
